### Reliability and applicability of magnetic-force linear response theory: Numerical parameters, predictability, and orbital resolution
[H. Yoon, T. J. Kim, J.-H. Sim, S. W. Jang, T. Ozaki, and M. J. Han, Phys. Rev. B 97, 125132 (2018).](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.125132)

> In this paper, we examined spin exchange interaction **J** on classical magnetic metal, insulator systems by MFT. Extensive tests were performed on numerical parameter dependences such as basis orbital set, LDA + U parameter.
Also, comparisons were made between MFT based on meta-stable spin configurations, and expansion to orbital-resolved magnetic interactions are presented.

### Jx: An open-source software for calculating magnetic interactions based on magnetic force theory.
[H. Yoon, T. J. Kim, J.-H. Sim, and M. J. Han, Computer Physics Communications 106927 (2019).](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.106927)

> The Opensource Jx code paper.
> In this paper, we presented why our code is user-friendly and also efficient tool to calculate magnetic interaction in solids and molecules.
We also describe the advantages of computing short- and long-range interactions in one-shot and capability of computing orbital-resolved matrices, local axis rotation.
